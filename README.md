a small project made to explore css animations => finally turned out to be a js animation oups lol
it used some real simple animation, the follow mouse thingy.
basically it just uses an event listener on the mouse moves, and calculates some stuff: x and y center of the eye, dimensions of the body (full screen so that it follows the mouse anywhere in the screen) and renders a sweet little animation (basic one where it goes to the calculated coordinates for the eyeball) where we see the coolest pixel art of an eye follow the mouse. 
cause they are watching your movement, haha. jk.
